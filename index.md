## BruceFest --- Friday, January 13th, 2023

![Kim Bruce](bruce-kim-2006.jpg){: style="margin-right:10px; float: left"}

Over a career spanning six decades, Kim has had an amazing impact as a researcher, educator, and community builder. We are planning a one-day workshop at Pomona College on **Friday, January 13th, 2023**, just before POPL. The workshop will feature contributed talks on topics related to Kim's interests (object-oriented programming, natural language semantics, pedagogy). We have made arrangements to publish post-proceedings as an edited volume in Dagstuhl's [OASIcs series](https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/oasics/). We hope you will join us to celebrate Kim's career
